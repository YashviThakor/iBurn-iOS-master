As a mobile installation, it will likely be found near the ARTery early in the AM before the bike tours depart.\r\nParticipants can learn about how espresso is made, how water is pressurized to extract the best flavor, and how pressurized steam controls the temperature of the water so it is \"just right\"!    It all starts with the beans, which have to be ground to the proper consistency.  See and feel what that consistency is, and how the aroma makes the cup all the better.   A pinch of playa dust and the experience is complete!",

Using a subversive formula of colliding seemingly innocent images with meaningful messages, my subtle alterations to known designs irrevocably disrupt their meaning. For instance, in my iconic Vandal Gummy series, I place the beloved sugary treat against a prison mugshot background, gripping an identity placard in between his gelatin paws. This juxtaposition between the nostalgic and the sinister has become a hallmark for my body of work. I cleverly and strategically encourage my viewers to examine their own critique of problematic institutions. It will look like a Giant 14' incarcerated Gummy Bear :)",
