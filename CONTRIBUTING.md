## Style

Some general guidelines for style. Not a hard rule, but can be helpful to see what other people recommend.

* [Swift Style Guide](https://github.com/github/swift-style-guide)
* [Objective-C Style Guide](https://github.com/github/objective-c-style-guide)

## Code Review

* Every feature/bugfix/etc should be done in a feature branch, and correspond to a single PR.
* To merge into master, submit a PR on GitHub to allow for code review.

## Tests

* When applicable, code should be written in a way that [facilitates testing](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/153410/what-are-the-design-principles-that-promote-testable-code-designing-testable-c).
* Whenever possible, new code should be accompanied by unit tests and integration tests.
* TDD (test driven development) is very helpful for quick iteration.
